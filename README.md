# BuildFailurePredictor

## 📌 Project Overview
BuildFailurePredictor is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a software build failing or succeeding.  
It uses data collection, feature engineering, and model training to create a predictive pipeline, helping developers identify risks in Continuous Integration (CI) environments before builds are executed.

## 🛠️ Features
- Collects and preprocesses build-related data  
- Performs feature engineering for better model performance  
- Trains and saves a machine learning model for failure prediction  
- Provides a prediction module (`predictor.py`) for real-time usage

```

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BuildFailurePredictor.git
   cd BuildFailurePredictor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python build_failure/model_training.py
   ```

2. Run predictions:
   ```bash
   python build_failure/predictor.py
   ```

3. Or use the main script:
   ```bash
   python build_failure/main.py
   ```
